# Google Co-laboratory notebook doesn't have the "Download as" drop-item in "File" menus like standalone Jyputer does.
# How to download the notebook as PDF?

# Fisrt, intall packages

!apt-get install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-latex-extra pandoc
!pip install pypandoc

# Second, If you want to set your working directory, do like Linux
% cd /content/drive/My\ Drive/Colab\ Notebooks/

!pwd # You can check whether it works

# Third, mount drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/')

# copy the files from the drive to the working directory (cuz drive is mounted as read only)
!cp drive/My\ Drive/Colab\ Notebooks/untitled.ipynb ./

# convert file as pdf
!jupyter nbconvert --to PDF "untitled.ipynb"
